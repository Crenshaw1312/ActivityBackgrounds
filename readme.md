It does override most themes as far as I can tell, If you encounter any errors, let me know.

## pc-spotify
Atm this is a little odd, but if you leave it on or off often, you're totally fine. THe issue is at re-setting the background, when first starting it you need to change your track to get it to show. disabling it works perfectly fine
> It does darken on hover, so reading what you may have there works perfectly fine
