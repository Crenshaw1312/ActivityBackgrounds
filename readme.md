## pc-spotify plugin
When you enable, you need to change your track (you can just skip ahead then back, or wait) to change the backgroud in the player

## Submit CSS/SCSS
There's an [issue template](https://github.com/Crenshaw1312/ActivityBackgrounds/issues/new?assignees=Crenshaw1312&labels=enhancement&template=css-request.md&title=CSS+Request) you can use, Include as much information as possible, if you want to write an essay, I'll probably read it, if you want to be short and to the point, that also works just as well.

I'll do my best to add it as soon as possible, if you PR it, I will ignore it.
